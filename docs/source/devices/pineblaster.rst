Pineblaster
===========

This labscript device controls the `PineBlaster <https://labscriptsuite.org/hardware/pineblaster/>`_ open-source digital pattern generator based on the Digilent chipKIT Max32 Prototyping platform.

.. warning::
    The chipKIT Max32 board is no longer commercially available. As such, this device is considered deprecated. We recommend the :doc:`PrawnBlaster <prawnblaster>` as a replacement device (for both new users looking for a cheap pseudoclock, and existing users of the PineBlaster). The PrawnBlaster microcontroller only costs ~$5USD and supports more instructions, multiple independent pseudoclocks, an internal wait monitor, and an easier connection for referencing to an external clock source.
